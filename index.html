            <p><span>Interventions</span> should focus on older adult's desire for connectedness, participation and independence.</p>
            <p>Loneliness and social isolation are growing public health concerns in our aging society. Whilst these experiences occur across the life span, 50% of individuals aged over 60 are at risk of social isolation and one-third will experience some degree of loneliness later in life. It is vital to reduce loneliness and social isolation among older adults.</p>
            <p>The methodology framework proposed by Arskey and O'Malley and further developed by Levac, et al. was used to guide the scoping review process. A total of 33 reviews met the inclusion criteria, evaluating a range of interventions targeted at older people residing in the community or institutionalised settings.</p>
